3. Use the demo data to run the GATK4 pipeline.
4. Generate the BAM files for S1 and S2 and VCF file.

## Part 2: Visualization with a Genome Browser
1. Load the BAM files and VCF file for samples S1 and S2 from part 1 into a genome browser.
2. Navigate to chr11 and select a random region that contains a variant and also has sequence(s) in both S1 and S2.
3. Export the selected region as a figure.
