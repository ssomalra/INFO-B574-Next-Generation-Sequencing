<b>Genomic Insights into ATF3 Regulation of Cell Proliferation of HepG2 Cells</b>

Previous research has indicated that increased expression of the Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) protein contributes to the inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and growth in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. In our investigation, we conducted ChIP-seq analysis to uncover the genomic loci to which ATF3 binds, aiming to elucidate the genes involved in the tumor-suppressive cascade. Our results revealed a specific ATF3 binding motif, TGACATCA, within the promoter regions of the genome. Furthermore, our study identified novel genes, including MAP2K3, which is involved in the cardiovascular fibrosis pathway response.
